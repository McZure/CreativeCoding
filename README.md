The latest update to axolotl.js now allows for multiple axolotl monsters to coexist simultaneously. With every click on the canvas, a new axolotl monster is created at the mouse position: a left-click spawns a randomly colored axolotl of the same species, while a right-click generates a random type of axolotl with a random color. Additionally, now, only the right arrow key remains active, functioning as a toggle switch for the deco feature. This simplification makes the user interface more intuitive and user-friendly.

A color palette has been introduced, shifting from purely random colors to a random combination of fixed color schemes. This enhances the visual consistency and diversity of the axolotls.

Moreover, weâ€™ve added a blinking effect to each eye type, ensuring that each axolotl has a unique blinking frequency. This small detail adds a touch of realism and individuality to each creature.

The weather system is NO longer a standalone feature. It has been integrated into the deco system, retaining all its interactions. However, these interactions are now triggered randomly, adding an element of surprise and engagement to the user experience.

With these updates, axolotl.js continues to evolve, offering a more dynamic and interactive environment for users to enjoy. Stay tuned for more exciting developments!
